## 🧠 **Key Learnings & Insights:**  

1. **Discount vs. Revenue Analysis:**  
   I explored the relationship between **discounts** and **revenue**. Through this analysis, I identified discount levels that boost revenue, while also pinpointing thresholds where increasing discounts results in diminishing returns.

2. **Optimal Discount Percentage for Maximum Profit:**  
   Using **DAX measures** and **Power BI visualizations**, I discovered the **optimal discount percentage** that maximizes profit. This insight is crucial for businesses aiming to balance **competitive pricing** with **profitability**.

3. **Discounts and Units Sold:**  
   I examined the correlation between **discounts** and **units sold** and found that, while higher discounts might increase sales, the **trade-off** between volume and profitability is significant. Companies need to identify the sweet spot to maintain profitability.
